# Healthcare Database System

This is my Healthcare Relational Database System Project —  used to explore healthcare datasets through data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and modeling. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can support decision-making in healthcare contexts.


# Dataset


The datasets used are synthetic/mock data that is simulated to represent a typical hospital or clinic system.  These files are included as .csv files.


# Project Structure/Database Schema

Table Structure

Patients: Stores personal info about patients

Doctors: Stores doctor details and specialties

Appointments: Manages scheduled consultations

Diagnoses: Records post-appointment medical observations and treatment


# Relationships:

1. Appointments link patients to doctors

2. Diagnoses are tied to appointments


# Data Import
Loads CSV files into MySQL using LOAD DATA INFILE

patients.csv

doctors.csv

appointments.csv

diagnoses.csv


# Queries Included
Patient filtering: Find patients born after a specific date

Appointment joins: Display upcoming appointments with doctor and patient info

Doctor stats: Count of doctors by specialty

### Example SQL Query
```sql
-- Filter patients born after 1990
SELECT * FROM Patients WHERE DOB > "1990-07-01";

-- Upcoming appointments with patient and doctor details
SELECT a.AppointmentID, a.AppointmentDate, 
       p.FirstName AS PatientFirstName, d.FirstName AS DoctorFirstName
FROM Appointments a
JOIN Patients p ON a.PatientID = p.PatientID
JOIN Doctors d ON a.DoctorID = d.DoctorID
WHERE a.AppointmentDate >= NOW()
ORDER BY a.AppointmentDate;

-- Number of doctors by specialty
SELECT Specialty, COUNT(*) AS NumDoctors
FROM Doctors
GROUP BY Specialty
ORDER BY NumDoctors DESC;
